# inbox-rest-api-sqlite3
Simple REST API made with Node.js utilizing sqlite3. Further change to be expected including Azure connection.

If cloned, you MUST initialize node js along with express and sqlite3 to gain the functionality 
by giving yourself the necessary node modules. 

To be noted: this is simply just a LOCAL REST API
